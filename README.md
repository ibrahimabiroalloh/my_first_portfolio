# My First Portfolio Website

This is my first personal portfolio website, created as part of my learning journey as a junior developer.

## About the Project
I built this portfolio website by following the YouTube tutorial **[Create a Responsive Personal Portfolio Website Design using HTML CSS and JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJE-ze4TfXc&list=PPSV&t=1s)** from *Cryptical Coder*.  
The project helped me practice responsive design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.

## About Me
My name is **Ibrahima Biro Diallo**, and I am currently an intern at **Conakry Academy of Software and Technology (CAST)**.  
As a junior developer, this is my first full project, and it marks the beginning of my journey in web development.

## Features
- Fully responsive design
